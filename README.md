## MatematikaCanggih Project
This project demonstrates a simple Java program to perform basic and advanced mathematical operations using object-oriented programming principles. It consists of three classes:
* Matematika: Handles basic mathematical operations (addition and multiplication).
* MatematikaCanggih: Extends the Matematika class to include advanced operations (modulus).
* MatematikaCanggihBeraksi: Provides a user interface for testing the operations using console inputs.
